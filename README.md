# Energy Usage Analysis

Simulates, stores, and analyzes energy consumption data across multiple regions, facilities, and machines using Python and SQLite. The project helps track energy usage patterns, identify high-consuming machines, and analyze monthly trends.

## Features

- Generate a realistic energy consumption dataset with Python and NumPy  
- Store and query data in a SQLite database  
- Analyze data using SQL queries executed via pandas  
- Identify total and average energy consumption by region and facility  
- Find top-consuming machines and high-usage records  
- Track monthly energy consumption trends

## Tools & Technologies

- Python (pandas, NumPy)  
- SQLite  
- SQL
